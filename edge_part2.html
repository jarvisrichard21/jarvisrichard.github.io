                <h1>EDGE Data Project – Part 2: Analysis</h1>
                <p>This section explores how EDGE’s incentive programs shape economic development across Memphis. Using five datasets provided by EDGE, I analyzed investment patterns, job creation, and geographic distribution to understand how these programs support businesses and communities.</p>
            </header>

            <h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
            <p>The analysis answers three core questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How much investment has EDGE supported across Memphis, and how does it vary by program?</li>
                <li>How many jobs were created or retained, and which programs contributed the most?</li>
                <li>How is EDGE investment distributed across Memphis ZIP codes or neighborhoods?</li>
            </ul>

            <hr/>

            <h2>1. Investment Across Programs</h2>
            <p>PILOTs (Payment‑In‑Lieu‑Of‑Taxes) account for the largest share of total investment. These projects typically involve large capital expenditures such as facility construction, equipment purchases, and multi‑phase expansions. Loans and TIFs support smaller‑scale redevelopment and business growth, while grants fill financial gaps for targeted community projects. Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) support major industrial expansions by reducing financing costs.</p>

            <p>Together, these programs form a layered investment strategy: PILOTs drive large‑scale industrial growth, grants and loans support smaller businesses, and bonds enable long‑term capital projects.</p>

            <hr/>

            <h2>2. Jobs Created or Retained</h2>
            <p>PILOTs are the primary engine of job creation and retention. Distribution and manufacturing dominate the PILOT portfolio, accounting for the majority of new and retained jobs. Multi‑phase expansions—such as DHL Supply Chain and JM Smucker LLC—demonstrate sustained workforce development over time.</p>

            <p>Loans and TIFs contribute to job creation at a smaller scale, often supporting neighborhood‑level businesses and redevelopment efforts. Across all programs, EDGE’s incentives show a consistent commitment to strengthening Memphis’ labor market.</p>

            <hr/>

            <h2>3. Geographic Distribution of Investment</h2>
            <p>EDGE investment is concentrated in key economic corridors across Memphis. PILOTs cluster heavily in ZIP code <strong>38118</strong>, a major logistics hub near the airport. Industrial Revenue Bonds cluster in <strong>38116</strong>, another area dominated by distribution and manufacturing facilities.</p>

            <p>Sequential ZIP clusters—38103, 38104, 38105, 38107, and 38109—share similar economic conditions and are located in close proximity. These neighborhoods often experience similar levels of opportunity, infrastructure, and workforce characteristics. Grants and FTZ‑77 designations appear across diverse neighborhoods, supporting community‑level development.</p>

                <li>Support revitalization in targeted areas.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <hr/>

            <h2>Equity & Community Impact</h2>
            <p>Across all programs, EDGE’s incentives show a consistent pattern: investment is concentrated in communities that have historically faced economic barriers. Requirements such as MWBE participation and job creation commitments ensure that companies receiving incentives contribute to local wealth‑building and workforce opportunities. EDGE’s tools are not just financial mechanisms—they are instruments of place‑based economic equity.</p>

            <hr/>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This analysis demonstrates how EDGE uses a diverse set of financial tools to support business growth, job creation, and community development across Memphis. By examining investment, employment, and geography together, a clear picture emerges: EDGE’s incentives reinforce the city’s industrial strengths while intentionally directing resources toward neighborhoods that need them most.</p>
