             <h1>EDGE Data Project – Part 1: ETL Pipeline</h1>
             <p>This section documents the full ETL process used to transform the five Memphis EDGE datasets into a clean, structured PostgreSQL database.</p>
            </header>
   
              <h2>ETL Overview</h2>
<p>ETL is a data engineering process that moves raw information from its original source into a clean, structured system where it can be analyzed.
<strong>It involves three stages: extracting data from external sources, transforming it through cleaning and standardization, and loading it into a database or warehouse.</strong> 
The result is a reliable pipeline of high‑quality data that can support analytics, reporting, dashboards, and other data‑driven products.</p>
        
            
         <h2>Extracting Data From External Sources</h2>
<p>The extraction phase involved downloading the raw EDGE program files from the Memphis Open Data Portal and preparing them for import into a PostgreSQL database. This step required validating each file’s structure and ensuring the source data could be recognized by PostgreSQL before any transformation work could begin.</p>
Challenges
<ul><li><strong>Incompatible data types:</strong> Several fields used ArcGIS‑specific types that PostgreSQL could not interpret.</li><li><strong>Schema mismatches:</strong> The original tables did not align with PostgreSQL’s schema rules, causing import failures.</li></ul>
Solution
<ul><li>I rewrote the table schemas to replace ArcGIS‑specific field types with standard PostgreSQL types and restructured the tables to meet PostgreSQL’s schema requirements. This ensured every file could be imported cleanly and consistently.</li></ul>
Why This Step Mattered
<p>PostgreSQL will reject any file with incompatible types or invalid schema definitions. Resolving these issues during extraction ensured the pipeline would not fail during the load phase and created a stable foundation for all downstream transformation and analysis.</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Standardized geographic fields (ZIP code, state, city, county) were cleaned and validated.</li>
            <li>Currency fields included symbols and commas, which prevented type conversion. I used Excel’s Find and Replace tool to strip formatting before loading.</li>
            <li>ArcGIS exports required schema redesign to align with PostgreSQL’s data types.</li>
        </ul>
         <hr/>
         <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Inconsistent Naming Conventions</h3>
            <p>Each EDGE program used different field names and formats. I analyzed each table individually, identified shared fields, and created a structure that could support all five datasets without losing important details.</p>

            <h3>Schema mismatches from ArcGIS</h3>
            <p>ArcGIS exports didn’t align with PostgreSQL’s data types. I redesigned the schemas to ensure compatibility and consistency.</p>

            <h3>Currency formatting issues</h3>
            <p>Monetary values included symbols and commas. I removed these formatting characters before type conversion.</p>

            <h3>Logical errors and misspellings</h3>
            <p>I corrected inconsistent spellings, fixed malformed entries, and removed unnecessary fields to improve data quality.</p>

        <hr/>
            <h2>Data Modeling Concepts</h2>
            <p>The EDGE datasets are flat, meaning each table stands alone without primary keys, foreign keys, or hierarchical relationships. Even though some tables share similar attributes, they are not relationally linked and can be analyzed independently.</p>

             <h2>What Comes Next</h2>   
              <p>With the cleaned and standardized data now stored in PostgreSQL, the next phase of the project will focus on analysis. 
            I plan to explore how financial incentives influence job creation, industry growth, and investment patterns across Memphis. 
            This will include building analytical reports, visualizations, and dashboards that highlight the economic impact of EDGE programs.</p>
