              <h2>ETL Overview</h2>
<p>ETL is a data engineering process that moves raw information from its original source into a clean, structured system where it can be analyzed.
It involves three stages: extracting data from external sources, transforming it through cleaning and standardization, and loading it into a database or warehouse. 
The result is a reliable pipeline of high‑quality data that can support analytics, reporting, dashboards, and other data‑driven products.</p>


          <h2>What I Built</h2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </h2>

<p>I extracted raw economic, financial, and geospatial data from the Memphis Open Data portal. Because the source files were generated through ArcGIS, the original tables had to be redesigned to fit PostgreSQL’s data types and schema rules.
After establishing a consistent schema pattern, I cleaned the raw files by removing unnecessary fields, correcting misspellings, and resolving logical inconsistencies.
Once the data was standardized, I imported each table into PostgreSQL using a reproducible loading process. This pipeline consolidates all five EDGE datasets into a single, structured data source that can support future analytical reports and dashboards.</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Standardized geographic fields (ZIP code, state, city, county) were cleaned and validated.</li>
            <li>Currency fields included symbols and commas, which prevented type conversion. I used Excel’s Find and Replace tool to strip formatting before loading.</li>
            <li>ArcGIS exports required schema redesign to align with PostgreSQL’s data types.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Inconsistent Naming Conventions</h3>
            <p>Each EDGE program used different field names and formats. I analyzed each table individually, identified shared fields, and created a structure that could support all five datasets without losing important details.</p>

            <h3>Schema mismatches from ArcGIS</h3>
            <p>ArcGIS exports didn’t align with PostgreSQL’s data types. I redesigned the schemas to ensure compatibility and consistency.</p>

            <h3>Currency formatting issues</h3>
            <p>Monetary values included symbols and commas. I removed these formatting characters before type conversion.</p>

            <h3>Logical errors and misspellings</h3>
            <p>I corrected inconsistent spellings, fixed malformed entries, and removed unnecessary fields to improve data quality.</p>

            
            <h2>Data Modeling Concepts</h2>
            <p>The EDGE datasets are flat, meaning each table stands alone without primary keys, foreign keys, or hierarchical relationships. Even though some tables share similar attributes, they are not relationally linked and can be analyzed independently.</p>
